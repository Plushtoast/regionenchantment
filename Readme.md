This module enhances a few tiny bits for the scene region configurations.

* The window header is colored according to the scene regions color (text with auto contrast color)
* Another Save button is added, which doesn't close the config immediately
* Regions can be hidden on the scene region layer. This should improve visibility if multiple layers are stacked on each other.
* Drag a region from the scene region legend onto the destination field of a teleport token behavior to store its uuid.
* Drag a region from the scene region legend onto the behaviors tab of a region config to add a teleport token behavior connected to that region
* Adds resizer to region legend


* Can replace multilevel token teleporters within a scene (but still...multilevel tokens is better)
